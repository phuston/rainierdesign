                    <h1>Formal Usability Test Design</h1>

                    <h2>Test 1: "Am I On Track" UI Element</h2>

                        <h3>Background and Hypothesis</h3>
                            <p>In our heuristic evaluation, we realized that progress bars were not helpful to our users in indicating how far they were in the process. It was unclear how certain tasks were weighted. We found that our users value knowing where they are in relation to where they should be, and that it was important to see a projected date on when they would finish all of their tasks. </p>

                            <p><strong>Hypothesis #1 (Different Styles):</strong> If we include a UI forecaster element that communicates to users the difference between where they should be and where they are then they will feel more inclined to take action and less stressed out about the amount of work they have to do.</p>

                            <p><strong>Hypothesis #2 (Different Placements):</strong> Depending on the placement of this UI forecaster, users will understand which categories need attention and not feel overwhelmed by the potential amount of work presented.</p>

                            <p><strong>Hypothesis #3 (Color Breakdown):</strong> If we include a color breakdown of which categories need attention in the overall forecast bar, users will know which of the specific categories they are behind on and feel motivated to take action on them.</p>

                        <h3>Independent Variables - What will vary?</h3>

                            <p>We will vary three things about the “Am I on track” bar: the placement of the bar, the UI design of the bar, and the color breakdown for all of the categories that need attention.</p>

                            <p>For placement of the bar, the two options include: 1. A place that represents the progress on their overall wedding planning (on a page above all of the categories) 2. A place that represents the progress on their overall wedding planning  (on a page above all of the categories) and a place that represents the progress on each category (on each category page). We are not placing the “Am I on track” bar on just the categories. This was in our initial design, but our heuristic evaluators provided us with the feedback that this was confusing, and instead prefered to see overall progress or overall progress and category progress.</p>

                            <p>For the UI design of the bar, we have two styles (seen below): </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Option 1 uses a half dome to represent their progress. On the dome, there would be two pointers, one marking the user’s progress and the other marking their progress relative to other users.</li>

                                    <li>Option 2 uses a timeline to represent their progress. On the timeline, there would again be two triangle pointers, one marking the user’s progress and the other marking.</li>
                                </ol>

                            <p>Each of our wedding categories would have a unique color. For the color breakdown of all the categories that need attention, we have two options:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>The space between the pointer that marks the user’s progress and the pointer that marks their progress compared to other people would be colored according to which categories need attention.</li>

                                <li>No color breakdown, just a red glow over the difference between the pointers when the user is behind.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <ol>

                                        Do you feel motivated to complete your tasks based on your tracker?
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Yes/No</li>

                                </ol>

                            <p><strong>Hypothesis #2:</strong> Measuring stress level</p>
                                <ol>

                                        Do you feel stressed by the progress tracker regarding the overall wedding status?
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Yes/No</li>

                                    <li>
                                        Do you feel stressed by the progress tracker regarding the overall wedding status and regarding the status of each category?
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Yes/No</li>

                                            <li>Yes/No</li>

                                </ol>

                        <h3>Patterns in Response Variables</h3>
                            <p><strong>"Am I on track" UI element:</strong></p>
                            <p>While someone can say they are “stressed” or “motivated” with very binary (yes/no) answers, we need a quantitative way to confirm these feelings.</p>

                            <p><strong>To measure if someone is stressed:</strong></p>
                            <p>We will be looking for metrics on how often a user lands at the progress bar page and exits out of the app or the page. Later, we can analyze time as a factor. For example, if someone immediately lands on the progress page and sees a color or style that makes them feel stressed they are more likely to exit out immediately.</p>

                            <p><strong>To measure if a user is aware of their progress:</strong></p>
                            <p>There is a difference between being aware you are behind and being motivated. A user could know they have a lot of tasks left to do, but not know how to catch up, or why it’s important they catch up. To measure awareness of progress on our two styles we will be looking if A) Users click on the portion of the half dome bar to see which categories they are behind on OR B) If they are presented with the horizontal progress bar we will observe whether or not they click on the running man icon which tells them information on how to catch up.</p>

                            <p><strong>To measure if someone is motivated:</strong></p>
                            <p>To measure whether or not people want to take action after seeing their progress we will be analyzing whether or not users click on the categories that require attention and the task completion rate.</p>

                        <h3>Test Conditions</h3>
                            <p>Ideally, we would test these prototypes with at least 8 people (and preferably many more) in order to understand what the best interface is for our application. Our team currently has 8 possible interactions for our forecasting element because of all of the different options we have, so we need at least 8 people to test them.  If available, testing over 32 people would be ideal to see if there is majority of people who were originally presented the same interface that had similar reactions to the elements in question. Each participant will only go through one interface since going through multiple interfaces will introduce bias into the experiment.  At the end of the test, after we have gone through the necessary questions to understand how the user responds to our response variables, we will present them with different design options to determine which of our other potential design resonate with them more visually, but we will not go through the entire usability study again.</p>

                    <h2>Test 2: Enhanced Signup Flow</h2>

                        <h3>Background and Hypothesis</h3>
                            <p>If our sign up flow is longer and includes more help text, then users will understand our definitions of a task, a category, how and when tasks are assigned, and what marking a task as done means.</p>

                        <h3>Independent Variables - What will vary?</h3>
                            <p> Internally, we have always evaluated our sign-up flow in terms of the burden placed on the user before they can see the value added by our app. Our current sign-up flow asks the user for their and their fiance’s names, their date and location, and what their availability is for completing tasks we assign them to plan their wedding. The results of our heuristic evaluation and our cognitive walkthroughs from the Design Refinement phase were that users were filling out this information without knowing that it could be changed later and users were not receiving any insight into the main interaction of the app—viewing, doing, and completing tasks.</p>

                            <p>We will be designing different sign-up flows that vary in terms of length and language used and presenting each flow we design to an individual user. We will keep constant the format of the sign-up flow and the set of interactions for moving through the sign-up flow. The user signs-up for this app in a desktop interface and is presented with a walkthrough where we solicit information from them. We do not intend to say that this walkthrough process is our final decision on the sign-up flow but we will keep it constant so as not to interfere with the dependent variables we expect to observe.</p>

                            <p>We do not have the requirement for this test that we test with actual users who have just started planning their own weddings. Instead, we must only ask a user who has never interacted with the app and doesn’t know our definitions of tasks, categories, etc. to complete the walkthrough. For each sign-up flow that we present to each individual user, we will try and standardize conditions, presenting it similarly to a cognitive walkthrough and observing the dependent variables after the walkthrough is completed.</p>

                        <h3>Dependent Variables - What response will we see?</h3>
                            <p>After completing one of the sign-up flows that we have designed, we will be asking the user the following questions:</p>

                            <div>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What is a task?</li>
                                    <li>What is a category?</li>
                                    <li>At what times will you be assigned a task by the app?</li>
                                    <li>What does marking a task as done mean?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                            <p>We will record the user’s answers to these questions and compare them to our own answers and score how well the user did out of 5 points. We will be assigning partial points depending on how accurate and inline a user’s answers are with our expectations.</p>

                            <p>We will also be asking the user, on a more qualitative level, about how burdensome they found the sign-up flow. We can ask the user to compare our flow to other sign-up processes, if it felt long or short, if they would have liked to skip some steps in the flow, and if they were aware that any information we are soliciting from the user will be editable once the sign-up flow is completed.</p>


                        <h3>Patterns in Response Variables</h3>
                            <p>Including more help text and being more clear in our signup flow will help our users understand key definitions in our app - primarily understanding the meaning of a task, a category, how and when tasks are assigned, and what marking a task as done means. If we present users with a more complete sign-up flow with clearer language and useful graphics, we expect that the users will be correct more often and more confident in their answers.</p>

                            <p>Additionally, we presume that there may be a tipping point where the returns in knowledge by increasing the length of the sign-up flow diminishes, and the users will instead become frustrated by how long it is. If we see users getting frustrated with the length of the sign-up flow, we plan on noting this and considering it as a tradeoff to the familiarity potentially gained.</p>

                        <h3>Test Conditions</h3>
                            <p>Ideally, we hope to test 6 participants who will each go through 1 iteration of the test. Unfortunately, we are limited to 1 iteration for each participant, as we’re testing their familiarity and understanding of the system on a high level. A participant’s bias would clearly carry over from one iteration to the next, and we wouldn’t get useful data from asking the same questions. We do, however, plan on showing other possible iterations on the sign-up flow design (if available), and asking the participants about their thoughts on the differences and what components may be better or worse (to the best of their ability). It should be noted that our team has no prior experience in the design of controlled experiments, at least in the context of design usability tests.</p>
