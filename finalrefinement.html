                        <h2> Our users </h2>
                            <p> The audience for our app, We Do, is people who plan their own weddings without a dedicated, paid wedding planner. In order to make sure that our app was as helpful as possible to our potential users, we spent the first phase interviewing people who plan their own weddings and researching the available tools that these people relied on the most. Eventually, we summarized all of this information into the following personas. (A more thorough write up on this can be found on our <a href = "http://hfid.olin.edu/sa2017/ranier/rainierdesign/needsanalysis.html"> Needs Analysis brief </a><p>
                            <p style = "padding: 50px;"> Sarah is an extremely organized and conscientious bride to-be. She started planning her wedding over a year in advance and values the opinions of people she trusts and being in creative control. <br> <br>
                            Judy, Sarah’s mom, is a very empathetic person with a focus on helping Sarah stay within her strict budget. She values being able to communicate with Sarah quickly and easily about tasks related to the wedding <br> <br> 
                            Rebecca is a more laid back bride to-be. She started planning her wedding less than a year in advance but feels that she is good at planning, so she’s not too worried about it.  Like Sarah, Rebecca values being in creative control.<br> <br> 
                            John is a businessman who has experience planning events and managing people.  Despite this experience, he does not feel super compelled to help with the research phase of planning and mostly steps in at the end to help his partner decide between a few options. He doesn’t care much for the wedding planning process, but wants his partner to have as little stress as possible. </p>
                            <p> With these personas in mind, we decided to aim our app towards people who want to have precise control over the wedding planning process, like Sarah, by allowing users to create a highly personalized experience. However, we also attempted to cater toward people like Rebecca, by developing experiences that are easy to use and helpful with limited customization. Additionally, we tried to support Sarah and Judy’s relationship and John and his partner’s relationship in our design by creating interfaces that encourage sharing and collaboration. </p>
                        <h2> Users' current tools </h2>
                            <p> Currently, people who plan their own weddings are using a variety of online and offline tools to help them through the process. Excel spreadsheets were by far the most common tool used to keep people organized and store information such as cell phone numbers, addresses for potential venues, day-of wedding schedules, and many other important lists. However, these spreadsheets were often extremely detailed and long. They made it hard for users to get a good idea of how far along in the process they were and how much left they really had to do. </p>
